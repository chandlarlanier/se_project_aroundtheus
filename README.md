# Around The U.S.

This project simulates a simplified social media platform that allows users to share their travel experiences around the United States. This project focuses on demonstrating API integration for data retrieval, editing, and deletion. Users can create posts highlighting their favorite travel destinations, edit their profiles, and interact with posts by liking and deleting them.


## Features
* User Profile Customization: Users can modify their profile name and description using a popup form. This feature allows users to personalize their profiles and provide additional information about themselves.

* Responsive Design: The webpage is designed with responsiveness in mind, utilizing grid display and media queries to ensure it adapts and displays appropriately on different devices and screen sizes. This allows users to have a consistent and user-friendly experience, whether they access the app on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

* Form Validation: The forms in the project incorporate validation mechanisms using JavaScript to ensure that the input provided by users is accurate and meets the required criteria. This includes verifying the correct number of characters and validating the format of input (i.e. URLs).

* Interactive Elements: The project incorporates CSS hover effects on buttons and other interactive elements, providing a visually pleasing and engaging user experience.

* Smooth Transitions: The project utilizes transitions to create smooth opening and closing effects for the popup forms. This enhances the overall user experience and adds a touch of interactivity to the platform.


## Plans for Improvement
* User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system to allow users to create accounts, log in, and securely access their profiles. This can include features like password reset, email verification, and account settings.

* Search Functionality: Add a search feature that allows users to search for specific posts or users based on keywords or tags. This can enhance the usability of the project and make it easier for users to find relevant content.

* Data Persistence and Database Integration: Integrate a database system to store user profiles, posts, and other data persistently. This will enable users to access their content across multiple sessions and ensure data integrity.
